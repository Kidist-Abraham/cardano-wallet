Overview
--------

Cardano Wallet helps you manage your Ada. You can use it to send and
receive payments on the `Cardano`_ blockchain.

This project provides an HTTP Application Programming Interface (API)
and command-line interface (CLI) for working with your wallet.

It can be used as a component of a frontend such as `Daedalus`_, which
provides a friendly user interface for wallets. Most users who would
like to use Cardano should start with Daedalus.

   :information_source: This source code repository contains the next
   major version of Cardano Wallet, which has been completely rewritten
   for the `Shelley`_ phase.

   :bulb: The Byron version of Cardano Wallet is in the `cardano-sl`_
   repository.

Getting Started
---------------

::

   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet/master/docker-compose.yml
   NETWORK=testnet docker-compose up

   Fantastic! The server is up-and-running, waiting for HTTP requests on
   localhost:8090/v2 e.g.:

::
   curl http://localhost:8090/v2/network/information

or to be accessed via CLI, e.g.:

::
   $ docker run --network host --rm inputoutput/cardano-wallet network information

See also `Wiki - Docker`_ for more information about using docker.
